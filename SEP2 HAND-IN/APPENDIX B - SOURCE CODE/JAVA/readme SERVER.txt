In order to run the server, it is necessary to run the Database
DDL on one's computer and, in every DAO on the Server side,
change the postgres credentials to the ones for the computer
trying to run the server.

These can be found by doing CTRL + SHIFT + F and looking for "1234".
This search will likely lead you to wherever the credentials are requested.
Replace them with your own and the system should be fine to run.
